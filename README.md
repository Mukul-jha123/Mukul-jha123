Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mukul Jha, a Final Year Computer Science and Engineering Student with a Passion for Solving Real-World Problems through Code ðŸš€
As the President of GNIOT Tech Club, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of leading and collaborating on innovative tech projects and hackathons, driving impactful change within our developer community. With hands-on experience in AI, Machine Learning, Blockchain, Data Analysis, and UI/UX Design, Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of challenging projects, including:

AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platform for Habitat for Humanity
A Decentralized Voting System leveraging Blockchain and React.js
Optimizing traffic systems with DFS Algorithms for real-time flow analysis
In addition to my academic projects, Iâ€™ve completed Software Engineering Virtual Experiences with J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs, where I worked on live data visualization using the @finos/perspective library, and IT governance analysis with security-focused insights.

Iâ€™m continuously enhancing my technical skills through certifications like Career Essentials in Generative AI and C++, and I love solving complex challenges with code to create meaningful impact. Always eager to collaborate and contribute to open-source projects!
